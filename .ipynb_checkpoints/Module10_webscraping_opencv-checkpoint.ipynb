Its sense-tingling spice plantations. Its pristine and protected natural surroundings. We even call it God&rsquo;s Own Country.

They have been specially crafted for newlyweds, taking into consideration everything couples would love to see, do, and experience. Don&rsquo;t wait any longer, make your partner&rsquo;s dream come true, in the spectacular destination that is Kerala.&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n<h2 id=\"how_to_reach_Kerala\" style=\"color: #0094da;\">How to Reach Kerala</h2>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Being such a popular tourist spot means Kerala has great connectivity making it&nbsp;boat rides on the backwaters. One can get on a flight, take trains, buses and even reach by car. It all depends on where you are coming from and how straightforward or adventurous you want your travel to be. The quickest and most convenient <a title=\"way to reach Kerala\" href=\"https://www.thomascook.in/india-tourism/how-to-reach-kerala\" target=\"_blank\">way to reach Kerala</a> is by air. There are four international airports located across the state, which also see domestic arrivals. For your trip to Kerala, you can fly into Thiruvananthapuram International Airport or Cochin International Airport, from all major cities across India.&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">But for those who love taking the scenic route, your trip to Kerala should be by train or road. There are countless trains running to various cities and towns across Kerala, from all over the country. The coastal stretch is considered one of the most picturesque train journeys of India. Or better still, take a private taxi or car. The road trip allows you to drive past spectacular vistas, quaint villages, and the ability to stop and soak it all in, whenever you like. Meanwhile, luxury and deluxe buses ply from all major cities to different parts of the state too. So you can choose any of these transport options to begin your Kerala holiday.&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n<h3>Travelling within Kerala</h3>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Public transport is available to take you around Kerala, such as local trains, buses, and taxis. It depends on how long a journey you wish to make. Most hotels offer car and driver services to make sightseeing and other trips convenient. You can also hire a car at the airport itself, for the entire duration of your stay. However, with Thomas Cook&rsquo;s Kerala tour packages you needn&rsquo;t worry, as transfers and excursions are included.&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n<h2 id=\"best_time_to_visit_Kerala\" style=\"color: #0094da;\">Best Time to Visit Kerala</h2>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You can plan a trip to Kerala at any time of the year, depending on the kind of weather you prefer. With tropical climate, Kerala has a hot, humid summer, a substantially heavy monsoon, and a pleasantly cool winter. Since Kerala has varied topography, cool and hot micro-climates exist too. By understanding each season, you can choose the right dates for your Kerala tour.</p>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Summer holidays in Kerala are great for those who wish to visit the hill-stations or experience some of the seasonal festivities such as Vishnu with temperatures often crossing the 40 degree mark, spending time at the beach or out sightseeing can be uncomfortably hot. On the other hand, this is a great time to look for off-season deals on Kerala tour packages. Hill stations like Munnar, Thekkady, Ponmudi, and Vagamon offer a lush green escape from the heat. But this is when you can find great off-season deals on Kerala packages. While places like Munnar, Thekkady, Ponmudi and Vagamon offer lush green escapes, high up in the hills, away from the heat. Monsoon arrives with a bang in June and tapers off by August end. If you enjoy the wet season or are a couple looking to experience the romance of the rain, then you should definitely search for a Kerala package within these months. This is also a great time to go on a spa focused Kerala trip, one that truly leaves you rejuvenated. This makes the <a title=\"best time to visit Kerala\" href=\"https://www.thomascook.in/india-tourism/best-time-to-visit-kerala\" target=\"_blank\">best time to visit Kerala</a>&nbsp;during the <strong>winter season, from September</strong> end to the start of March. Most people opt to spend their holidays in Kerala during this time, as the favourable weather makes the beaches idyllic, the backwaters are at their best and the outdoors in general become more accessible. So even city-centric getaways are more fun, allowing you to have the entire gamut of Kerala holidays experiences to pick from. But if you are going to go during winter, booking your Kerala tour package in advance is recommended.</p>\\r\\n<h2 id=\"best_places_to_visit_in_Kerala\" style=\"color: #0094da;\">Best Places to&nbsp;Visit in Kerala</h2>\\r\\n<br /><center><img src=\"https://www.thomascook.in/images/seo-images/kerala-places-to-visit-infographic.jpg\" alt=\"Places to Visit Kerala Infographic\" width=\"800\" height=\"500\" /></center><br />\\r\\n<p>Below&nbsp;are the best places to visit in Kerala during your Kerala Trip.</p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>Munnar</li>\\r\\n<li>Alappuzha</li>\\r\\n<li>Kochi</li>\\r\\n<li>Kovalam</li>\\r\\n<li>Kumarakom</li>\\r\\n<li>Wayanad</li>\\r\\n<li>Kozhikode</li>\\r\\n<li>Chinnar Wildlife Sanctuary</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<h3>Munnar</h3>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Perched on the plantation-filled hills of Kerala is the charming town of Munnar.

This special ecosystem means Alappuzha offers visitors exquisite flowing waters flanked on either side by tropical palms and trees, that you can call home for a night, or maybe a few. Staying on a houseboat isn&rsquo;t something you can do too often, so why not make the most of the opportunity.&nbsp; But that doesn&rsquo;t there&rsquo;s no reason to get your feet on solid land. Alappuzha is also home to significant landmarks, like St. Mary Forane Church, the oldest in all of India! While Alapuzzha Beach is another lovely spot for a day of sun, sand, and frolic.

Where you will discover a rich mix of history, spectacular architecture, nature in all its glory, a bustling food scene, heritage arts and craft, beautiful sacred sites &mdash; a heady blend of all things that make travel such an enlightening experience. Don&rsquo;t miss out on popular tourist attractions like the Mattancherry Palace, the Chinese Fishing Nets, St. Francis Church, the Into-Portuguese Museum and Paradesi Synagogue.

Golden sands, thrilling water sports, swaying palms to hammock between, secluded stretches with views reserved just for you. And if that&rsquo;s not enough, a whole host of sites to visit beyond the beach, like the Halcyon Castle, Rock Cut Cave Temple, Neyyar Dam, Vellayani Lake, Napier Art Museum &amp; Gallery and Shri Chitra Art Gallery. With so much to offer, Kovalam surely deserves to be part of your Kerala trip.&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n<h3>Kumarakom</h3>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Holidays in Kerala get even more magical when you visit the beautiful district of Kumarakom, where the backwaters cut through lush farmlands, paddy fields and coconut groves. Offering exceptional vistas and the solitude to truly enjoy them. Here you&rsquo;ll not only get to tick staying on a houseboat off your itinerary, but also experience exciting activities like yachting at Vembanad Lake, one of Asia&rsquo;s largest freshwater lakes. As well as cultural tours of local heritage sites like Vaikom Mahadeva Temple, St. Mary&rsquo;s Church, Jama Masjid, and the Shiva Temple.&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n<h3>Wayanad</h3>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Known for its breezy paddy fields, thriving tea, coffee and spice plantations, pristine mountainsides, vibrant history, and culture, <a title=\"Wayanad - Kerala\" href=\"https://blog.thomascook.in/places-to-visit-in-wayanad/\" target=\"_blank\">Wayanad</a> promises a refreshing getaway from life as you know it.

Most recommended place on your Kerala package.</p>\\r\\n<h3>Kozhikode</h3>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A true traveller&rsquo;s pick of places to visit on a trip to Kerala, Kozhikode &mdash; or Calicut as it was known &mdash; is a significant location on the historic map of Kerala, and indeed India. For it is where famed explorer Vasco Da Gama first landed. The once-bustling trade port is now a spectacular fusion city, with nature and heritage co-existing to form its own unique ambience. Where you can spend your holidays in Kerala on quaint beaches, old world temples, the wild mangroves, or a craft village.&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n<h3>Chinnar Wildlife Sanctuary</h3>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Visit one of the twelve protected wildlife sanctuaries, the Chinnar Wildlife Sanctuary, as part of your Kerala holidays. Get as far away from city life for a close up view of nature at its finest, in the heart of the stunning Anamalai Hills.

Its unique texture is what makes the side such a staple across all of Kerala. While the plain flavour allows for myriad curry pairings, be it egg, vegetarian, meat, or seafood. The most common combination is Idiyappam and egg curry. A filling meal that can be had for lunch or dinner, and a truly authentic regional culinary experience.

Taste familiar flavours at an elevated level, that you can have by itself or accompanied by rice. Almost all local restaurants will have Parippu Curry on their menu, so there&rsquo;s no reason for you to miss out on this mouthwatering staple.&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n<h3>Appam &amp; Ishtu</h3>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">One of the traditional culinary specialties that you must try on your trip to Kerala, is Appam with Ishtu. Like many South Indian delicacies, appams are made of fermented rice flower along with coconut milk and water, and a sprinkle of jaggery. They are soft, yet crisp-edged pancakes that must be had with a local version of a stew, which can be vegetarian or meaty, as per your preference. A sumptuous feast of native ingredients that captures the state&rsquo;s blended heritage. Try this delicacy on your next Kerala trip.</p>\\r\\n<h3>Puttu &amp; Kadala Curry</h3>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Start every day of your holidays in Kerala with a hearty local breakfast.

One can get on a flight, take trains, buses and even reach by car. It all depends on where you are coming from and how straightforward or adventurous you want your travel to be. The quickest and most convenient <a title=\"way to reach Kerala\" href=\"https://www.thomascook.in/india-tourism/how-to-reach-kerala\" target=\"_blank\">way to reach Kerala</a> is by air. There are four international airports located across the state, which also see domestic arrivals. For your trip to Kerala, you can fly into Thiruvananthapuram International Airport or Cochin International Airport, from all major cities across India.&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">But for those who love taking the scenic route, your trip to Kerala should be by train or road. There are countless trains running to various cities and towns across Kerala, from all over the country. The coastal stretch is considered one of the most picturesque train journeys of India. Or better still, take a private taxi or car. The road trip allows you to drive past spectacular vistas, quaint villages, and the ability to stop and soak it all in, whenever you like. Meanwhile, luxury and deluxe buses ply from all major cities to different parts of the state too. So you can choose any of these transport options to begin your Kerala holiday.&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n<h3>Travelling within Kerala</h3>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Public transport is available to take you around Kerala, such as local trains, buses, and taxis. It depends on how long a journey you wish to make. Most hotels offer car and driver services to make sightseeing and other trips convenient. You can also hire a car at the airport itself, for the entire duration of your stay. However, with Thomas Cook&rsquo;s Kerala tour packages you needn&rsquo;t worry, as transfers and excursions are included.&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n<h2 id=\"best_time_to_visit_Kerala\" style=\"color: #0094da;\">Best Time to Visit Kerala</h2>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You can plan a trip to Kerala at any time of the year, depending on the kind of weather you prefer. With tropical climate, Kerala has a hot, humid summer, a substantially heavy monsoon, and a pleasantly cool winter. Since Kerala has varied topography, cool and hot micro-climates exist too. By understanding each season, you can choose the right dates for your Kerala tour.</p>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Summer holidays in Kerala are great for those who wish to visit the hill-stations or experience some of the seasonal festivities such as Vishnu with temperatures often crossing the 40 degree mark, spending time at the beach or out sightseeing can be uncomfortably hot. On the other hand, this is a great time to look for off-season deals on Kerala tour packages. Hill stations like Munnar, Thekkady, Ponmudi, and Vagamon offer a lush green escape from the heat. But this is when you can find great off-season deals on Kerala packages. While places like Munnar, Thekkady, Ponmudi and Vagamon offer lush green escapes, high up in the hills, away from the heat. Monsoon arrives with a bang in June and tapers off by August end. If you enjoy the wet season or are a couple looking to experience the romance of the rain, then you should definitely search for a Kerala package within these months. This is also a great time to go on a spa focused Kerala trip, one that truly leaves you rejuvenated. This makes the <a title=\"best time to visit Kerala\" href=\"https://www.thomascook.in/india-tourism/best-time-to-visit-kerala\" target=\"_blank\">best time to visit Kerala</a>&nbsp;during the <strong>winter season, from September</strong> end to the start of March. Most people opt to spend their holidays in Kerala during this time, as the favourable weather makes the beaches idyllic, the backwaters are at their best and the outdoors in general become more accessible. So even city-centric getaways are more fun, allowing you to have the entire gamut of Kerala holidays experiences to pick from. But if you are going to go during winter, booking your Kerala tour package in advance is recommended.</p>\\r\\n<h2 id=\"best_places_to_visit_in_Kerala\" style=\"color: #0094da;\">Best Places to&nbsp;Visit in Kerala</h2>\\r\\n<br /><center><img src=\"https://www.thomascook.in/images/seo-images/kerala-places-to-visit-infographic.jpg\" alt=\"Places to Visit Kerala Infographic\" width=\"800\" height=\"500\" /></center><br />\\r\\n<p>Below&nbsp;are the best places to visit in Kerala during your Kerala Trip.</p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>Munnar</li>\\r\\n<li>Alappuzha</li>\\r\\n<li>Kochi</li>\\r\\n<li>Kovalam</li>\\r\\n<li>Kumarakom</li>\\r\\n<li>Wayanad</li>\\r\\n<li>Kozhikode</li>\\r\\n<li>Chinnar Wildlife Sanctuary</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<h3>Munnar</h3>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Perched on the plantation-filled hills of Kerala is the charming town of Munnar. The once-colonial summer town is today a lush, vibrant region where exotic teas and spices are grown, authentic rustic village life still exists, and nature thrives in myriad shapes and colours. Any Kerala trip itinerary that includes Munnar, promises exquisite experiences. Like cycling through the plantations, animal spotting at Eravikulam National Park, boat riding at Mattupetty Dam, picnicking at Hydel Park and sampling local culture at the famed Tea Museum. A heavenly retreat for couples or families looking spend quality time with one another, in enchanting surrounds.&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n<h3>Alappuzha</h3>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A tiny district in Kerala is most famous for its backwater tours. This special ecosystem means Alappuzha offers visitors exquisite flowing waters flanked on either side by tropical palms and trees, that you can call home for a night, or maybe a few. Staying on a houseboat isn&rsquo;t something you can do too often, so why not make the most of the opportunity.&nbsp; But that doesn&rsquo;t there&rsquo;s no reason to get your feet on solid land.

Its unique texture is what makes the side such a staple across all of Kerala. While the plain flavour allows for myriad curry pairings, be it egg, vegetarian, meat, or seafood. The most common combination is Idiyappam and egg curry. A filling meal that can be had for lunch or dinner, and a truly authentic regional culinary experience. Must try dish on your Kerala trip.</p>\\r\\n<h3>Parippu Curry</h3>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Every part of India has its own dal. And Kerala is no different. Here you will find the delicious, homely goodness of Parippu Curry, made of small gram lentil, ghee, and spices. Taste familiar flavours at an elevated level, that you can have by itself or accompanied by rice. Almost all local restaurants will have Parippu Curry on their menu, so there&rsquo;s no reason for you to miss out on this mouthwatering staple.&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n<h3>Appam &amp; Ishtu</h3>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">One of the traditional culinary specialties that you must try on your trip to Kerala, is Appam with Ishtu. Like many South Indian delicacies, appams are made of fermented rice flower along with coconut milk and water, and a sprinkle of jaggery. They are soft, yet crisp-edged pancakes that must be had with a local version of a stew, which can be vegetarian or meaty, as per your preference. A sumptuous feast of native ingredients that captures the state&rsquo;s blended heritage. Try this delicacy on your next Kerala trip.</p>\\r\\n<h3>Puttu &amp; Kadala Curry</h3>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Start every day of your holidays in Kerala with a hearty local breakfast. With dishes like Puttu, a steamed rice cake stuffed with grated coconut, that is served with fresh bananas or Kadala Curry, which is a lovely black chickpea preparation. A super affordable and yummy local specialty that&rsquo;s easy to find all over Kerala.&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n<h2 id=\"things_to_do_in_Kerala\" style=\"color: #0094da;\">Things to Do in Kerala</h2>\\r\\n<p>Below are our recommended things to do during Kerala Tour:</p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>Watch the Neelakurinji bloom</li>\\r\\n<li>Try the many exotic teas</li>\\r\\n<li>Stay in a houseboat</li>\\r\\n<li>Watch the Snake Boat Race</li>\\r\\n<li>Live in a treehouse</li>\\r\\n<li>Watch Theyyam</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<h3>Watch the Neelakurinji bloom</h3>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For the lucky few, a Kerala tour promises a rare natural phenomenon that can only be witnessed once every 12 years &mdash; the bloom of the Neelakurinji flowers.

      "<h2 id=\"how_to_reach_Kerala\" style=\"color: #0094da;\">How to Reach Kerala</h2>\r\n",
      "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Being such a popular tourist spot means Kerala has great connectivity making it&nbsp;boat rides on the backwaters. One can get on a flight, take trains, buses and even reach by car. It all depends on where you are coming from and how straightforward or adventurous you want your travel to be. The quickest and most convenient <a title=\"way to reach Kerala\" href=\"https://www.thomascook.in/india-tourism/how-to-reach-kerala\" target=\"_blank\">way to reach Kerala</a> is by air. There are four international airports located across the state, which also see domestic arrivals. For your trip to Kerala, you can fly into Thiruvananthapuram International Airport or Cochin International Airport, from all major cities across India.&nbsp;</p>\r\n",
      "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">But for those who love taking the scenic route, your trip to Kerala should be by train or road. There are countless trains running to various cities and towns across Kerala, from all over the country. The coastal stretch is considered one of the most picturesque train journeys of India. Or better still, take a private taxi or car. The road trip allows you to drive past spectacular vistas, quaint villages, and the ability to stop and soak it all in, whenever you like. Meanwhile, luxury and deluxe buses ply from all major cities to different parts of the state too. So you can choose any of these transport options to begin your Kerala holiday.&nbsp;</p>\r\n",
      "<h3>Travelling within Kerala</h3>\r\n",
      "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Public transport is available to take you around Kerala, such as local trains, buses, and taxis. It depends on how long a journey you wish to make. Most hotels offer car and driver services to make sightseeing and other trips convenient. You can also hire a car at the airport itself, for the entire duration of your stay. However, with Thomas Cook&rsquo;s Kerala tour packages you needn&rsquo;t worry, as transfers and excursions are included.&nbsp;</p>\r\n",
      "<h2 id=\"best_time_to_visit_Kerala\" style=\"color: #0094da;\">Best Time to Visit Kerala</h2>\r\n",
      "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You can plan a trip to Kerala at any time of the year, depending on the kind of weather you prefer. With tropical climate, Kerala has a hot, humid summer, a substantially heavy monsoon, and a pleasantly cool winter. Since Kerala has varied topography, cool and hot micro-climates exist too. By understanding each season, you can choose the right dates for your Kerala tour.</p>\r\n",
      "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Summer holidays in Kerala are great for those who wish to visit the hill-stations or experience some of the seasonal festivities such as Vishnu with temperatures often crossing the 40 degree mark, spending time at the beach or out sightseeing can be uncomfortably hot. On the other hand, this is a great time to look for off-season deals on Kerala tour packages. Hill stations like Munnar, Thekkady, Ponmudi, and Vagamon offer a lush green escape from the heat. But this is when you can find great off-season deals on Kerala packages. While places like Munnar, Thekkady, Ponmudi and Vagamon offer lush green escapes, high up in the hills, away from the heat. Monsoon arrives with a bang in June and tapers off by August end. If you enjoy the wet season or are a couple looking to experience the romance of the rain, then you should definitely search for a Kerala package within these months. This is also a great time to go on a spa focused Kerala trip, one that truly leaves you rejuvenated. This makes the <a title=\"best time to visit Kerala\" href=\"https://www.thomascook.in/india-tourism/best-time-to-visit-kerala\" target=\"_blank\">best time to visit Kerala</a>&nbsp;during the <strong>winter season, from September</strong> end to the start of March. Most people opt to spend their holidays in Kerala during this time, as the favourable weather makes the beaches idyllic, the backwaters are at their best and the outdoors in general become more accessible. So even city-centric getaways are more fun, allowing you to have the entire gamut of Kerala holidays experiences to pick from. But if you are going to go during winter, booking your Kerala tour package in advance is recommended.</p>\r\n",

      "<h3>Kumarakom</h3>\r\n",

For it is where famed explorer Vasco Da Gama first landed. The once-bustling trade port is now a spectacular fusion city, with nature and heritage co-existing to form its own unique ambience. Where you can spend your holidays in Kerala on quaint beaches, old world temples, the wild mangroves, or a craft village.&nbsp;</p>\r\n",
      "<h3>Chinnar Wildlife Sanctuary</h3>\r\n",
      "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Visit one of the twelve protected wildlife sanctuaries, the Chinnar Wildlife Sanctuary, as part of your Kerala holidays. Get as far away from city life for a close up view of nature at its finest, in the heart of the stunning Anamalai Hills. The area is home to over 28 mammals including leopards, tigers, elephants, and deer. While a whopping 225 bird species and 52 reptiles also share these forests. All creatures big and small, co-exist here. And for a brief while, you can join them and feel truly connected to nature.&nbsp;</p>\r\n",
      "<h2 id=\"what_to_eat_in_Kerala\" style=\"color: #0094da;\">What to Eat in Kerala</h2>\r\n",
      "<p>Here are our picks of food that you should taste in Kerala:</p>\r\n",
      "<ul>\r\n",
      "<li>Idiyappam &amp; Curry</li>\r\n",
      "<li>Parippu Curry</li>\r\n",
      "<li>Appam &amp; Ishtu</li>\r\n",
      "<li>Puttu &amp; Kadala Curry</li>\r\n",
      "</ul>\r\n",
      "<h3>Idiyappam &amp; Curry</h3>\r\n",
      "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Idiyappams are almost like noodle cakes, made of rice flour, salt and water. Its unique texture is what makes the side such a staple across all of Kerala. While the plain flavour allows for myriad curry pairings, be it egg, vegetarian, meat, or seafood. The most common combination is Idiyappam and egg curry. A filling meal that can be had for lunch or dinner, and a truly authentic regional culinary experience. Must try dish on your Kerala trip.</p>\r\n",
      "<h3>Parippu Curry</h3>\r\n",
      "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Every part of India has its own dal. And Kerala is no different. Here you will find the delicious, homely goodness of Parippu Curry, made of small gram lentil, ghee, and spices. Taste familiar flavours at an elevated level, that you can have by itself or accompanied by rice. Almost all local restaurants will have Parippu Curry on their menu, so there&rsquo;s no reason for you to miss out on this mouthwatering staple.&nbsp;</p>\r\n",
      "<h3>Appam &amp; Ishtu</h3>\r\n",
      "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">One of the traditional culinary specialties that you must try on your trip to Kerala, is Appam with Ishtu. Like many South Indian delicacies, appams are made of fermented rice flower along with coconut milk and water, and a sprinkle of jaggery. They are soft, yet crisp-edged pancakes that must be had with a local version of a stew, which can be vegetarian or meaty, as per your preference. A sumptuous feast of native ingredients that captures the state&rsquo;s blended heritage. Try this delicacy on your next Kerala trip.</p>\r\n",
      "<h3>Puttu &amp; Kadala Curry</h3>\r\n",
      "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Start every day of your holidays in Kerala with a hearty local breakfast. With dishes like Puttu, a steamed rice cake stuffed with grated coconut, that is served with fresh bananas or Kadala Curry, which is a lovely black chickpea preparation. A super affordable and yummy local specialty that&rsquo;s easy to find all over Kerala.&nbsp;</p>\r\n",
      "<h2 id=\"things_to_do_in_Kerala\" style=\"color: #0094da;\">Things to Do in Kerala</h2>\r\n",
      "<p>Below are our recommended things to do during Kerala Tour:</p>\r\n",
      "<ul>\r\n",

      "<li>Watch Theyyam</li>\r\n",
      "</ul>\r\n",
      "<h3>Watch the Neelakurinji bloom</h3>\r\n",
      "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For the lucky few, a Kerala tour promises a rare natural phenomenon that can only be witnessed once every 12 years &mdash; the bloom of the Neelakurinji flowers. When the western hills of Munnar, are engulfed by the stunning carpet of these purple native flowers.</p>\r\n",
      "<h3>Try the many exotic teas</h3>\r\n",
      "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">From tea gardens upon hilltops to street-side chai vendors, sample all the many flavours and varieties of tea that are grown and prepared across Kerala, especially in Idukki. A spectacular view comes with every brew.&nbsp;</p>\r\n",
      "<h3>Stay in a houseboat</h3>\r\n",
      "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Very few holidays present you with the chance to live on a houseboat, that too on the <a title=\"magnificent backwaters\" href=\"https://blog.thomascook.in/the-backwaters-of-kerala-for-honeymooners/\" target=\"_blank\">magnificent backwaters</a>. This unique experience simply cannot be passed over. So plan a few nights of your Kerala trip accordingly or select a Kerala tour package that includes a thrilling houseboat stay.</p>\r\n",
      "<h3>Watch the Snake Boat Race</h3>\r\n",
      "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Snake Boat Race, held in the backwaters of Alleppey is a good reason to book a Kerala tour package between August-September, to witness the marvellous snake carved boats being oared across the waters, alongside colourful Onam celebrations.</p>\r\n",
      "<h3>Live in a treehouse</h3>\r\n",
      "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Houseboats aren&rsquo;t the only special accommodation you can find in Kerala. Many resorts and lodges offer treehouses that are rustic in charm yet modern in finishing. Just one of the many Kerala tour experiences that leave you in the loving lap of nature.&nbsp;</p>\r\n",
      "<h3>Watch Theyyam</h3>\r\n",
      "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Add an artistic touch to your Kerala package by including a Theyyam performance in your itinerary. This North Kerala tradition is a sight to behold, with music, dance and theatrics all included. Discover local rituals and legends, packaged into one spectacular extravaganza.</p>\r\n",
